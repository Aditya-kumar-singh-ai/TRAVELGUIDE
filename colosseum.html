    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>The Colosseum, also known as the Flavian Amphitheater, is one of the most famous landmarks in Rome and a symbol of ancient Roman engineering and architecture. Located in the heart of Rome, Italy, the Colosseum was built between 70 and 80 AD under the emperors Vespasian and Titus. It was originally used for gladiatorial contests, public spectacles, animal hunts, and mock naval battles. With a seating capacity of around 50,000 spectators, it was the largest amphitheater in the Roman Empire and remains the largest amphitheater in the world today.</p>
    <p>The Colosseum is an architectural marvel, built from concrete and stone, and it features a series of arches and columns that showcase the engineering prowess of ancient Romans. Over the centuries, the Colosseum has suffered from earthquakes, fires, and stone robbers, but it still stands as a testament to the grandeur of Roman culture.</p>
