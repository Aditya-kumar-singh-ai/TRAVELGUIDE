    <h2>History of Seville Cathedral</h2>
    <p>The history of Seville Cathedral dates back to the early 15th century when it was built on the site of a former mosque. After the Christian Reconquista in 1248, Seville became part of the Kingdom of Castile, and the mosque was converted into a Christian church. However, the mosque was eventually demolished to make way for a grander structure that would reflect the power and wealth of the city.</p>
    <p>The construction of the Seville Cathedral began in 1401, and it took over a century to complete. The cathedral was designed in the Gothic style, but it also incorporates elements from earlier Moorish and Romanesque architecture. The most prominent feature of the cathedral is the Giralda Tower, which was originally a minaret of the mosque and later transformed into a bell tower for the cathedral.</p>
    <p>The cathedral was consecrated in 1507, and it has since undergone several expansions and renovations. Today, the cathedral stands as a testament to the artistic and architectural achievements of Seville and is one of Spain’s most visited landmarks.</p>
