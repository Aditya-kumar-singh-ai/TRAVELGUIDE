        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>The canals of Venice date back to the city’s founding in the 5th century.

        <p>Over time, the canals evolved from practical transportation routes to important cultural landmarks, contributing to Venice’s iconic status. The canals also played a key role in the rise of Venice as a major maritime power during the Middle Ages and Renaissance.</p>
