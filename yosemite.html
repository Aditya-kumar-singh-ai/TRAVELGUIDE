    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>The history of Yosemite is deeply intertwined with both natural and human elements. Indigenous peoples, particularly the Ahwahneechee tribe, have lived in the Yosemite Valley for thousands of years, relying on the land for sustenance. European settlers first encountered the valley in the mid-1800s, and by 1864, President Abraham Lincoln signed the Yosemite Grant, setting aside the land as a protected area. This marked the first time in U.S. history that land was set aside for public preservation. In 1890, Yosemite became a national park, and it has since become a symbol of conservation efforts in the United States.</p>

    <h2>Top Attractions</h2>
    <p>Yosemite is filled with natural wonders and iconic landmarks. Here are some of the park's must-see attractions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>El Capitan</strong> – A massive granite monolith that rises over 3,000 feet above Yosemite Valley. El Capitan is world-famous among climbers, but even if you're not a climber, its sheer size and beauty are awe-inspiring.</li>
        <li><strong>Half Dome</strong> – One of the most recognizable landmarks in Yosemite, Half Dome is a unique granite formation that stands at 8,844 feet. Hiking to the top is a challenging, but rewarding, trek for experienced hikers.</li>
        <li><strong>Yosemite Falls</strong> – The tallest waterfall in North America, with a total drop of 2,425 feet. Yosemite Falls is a stunning sight, particularly in the spring when the snowmelt brings the falls to life.</li>
        <li><strong>Glacier Point</strong> – Offering one of the most spectacular panoramic views in the park, Glacier Point overlooks Yosemite Valley, Half Dome, and the High Sierra peaks. It’s accessible by car in the summer and fall, or you can hike up if you're looking for an adventure.</li>
        <li><strong>Mariposa Grove of Giant Sequoias</strong> – Home to over 500 mature giant sequoia trees, this ancient grove includes the famous Grizzly Giant, which is estimated to be over 1,800 years old.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Wildlife and Nature</h2>
    <p>Yosemite is home to a diverse range of flora and fauna. The park’s varied ecosystems—ranging from lush valleys and rivers to high alpine meadows and dense forests—provide habitat for hundreds of animal species. Wildlife commonly seen in the park includes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Mule Deer</strong> – These graceful animals are commonly seen grazing throughout the park.</li>
        <li><strong>Black Bears</strong> – While black bears are present, they are generally shy and are best viewed from a safe distance.</li>
        <li><strong>Bobcats and Coyotes</strong> – These elusive predators are often seen in the park’s more remote areas.</li>
        <li><strong>Bald Eagles</strong> – Yosemite is home to several pairs of nesting Bald Eagles, particularly in the Tuolumne Meadows area.</li>
        <li><strong>Mountain Lions</strong> – While rare, mountain lions are known to inhabit the park’s more rugged regions.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The park also boasts a rich diversity of plant life, including the iconic Ponderosa Pines, wildflowers, and the towering sequoias. Yosemite’s unique geology has helped shape its ecosystem, with volcanic rock formations and glacial activity providing a backdrop for life to thrive.</p>

    <h2>Best Time to Visit</h2>
    <p>The best time to visit Yosemite depends on what you want to experience. The summer months (June to September) are the most popular, as all areas of the park are accessible, and the weather is warm, perfect for hiking and sightseeing. However, this is also when the park is most crowded. Spring (April to June) and fall (September to November) offer mild temperatures and fewer crowds, making them ideal for those who prefer a quieter experience. Winter (December to March) brings snow to Yosemite, transforming the park into a winter wonderland, perfect for snowshoeing, cross-country skiing, and a peaceful getaway.</p>

    <h2>How to Get There</h2>
    <p>Yosemite National Park is accessible by car, bus, and even by plane. The nearest major airport is in Fresno (FAT), about 2.5 hours away, or you can fly into San Francisco (SFO) or Sacramento (SMF) and drive to the park. If you're driving from the Bay Area, take Interstate 580 to 205 East, then take 120 East to the park's Big Oak Flat entrance. Be prepared for winding mountain roads, especially during winter months when chains may be required in snow conditions.</p>
