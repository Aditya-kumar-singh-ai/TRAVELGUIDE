    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>The construction of the Golden Temple began in 1581 under the guidance of Guru Ram Das, the fourth Sikh Guru, and was completed by his successor, Guru Arjan Dev, in 1604. The temple was designed to be a place of worship for all people, regardless of caste, religion, or background. It was also intended to be a symbol of equality and unity, with the central structure of the temple surrounded by a sacred pool of water, known as the **Amrit Sarovar**.</p>

    <h2>Architectural Features</h2>
    <p>The Golden Temple is an exquisite blend of Hindu and Islamic architectural styles. Its most striking feature is its gold-covered exterior, which gives the temple its name. The main temple is located on an island in the center of the **Amrit Sarovar**, and is accessible via a marble causeway known as the **Darshani Deori**.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>The Golden Dome:</strong> The temple is known for its gold-plated dome, which is surrounded by intricate marble and gemstone inlay work.</li>
        <li><strong>The Harmandir Sahib:</strong> The main sanctum inside the temple houses the **Adi Granth**, the central religious scripture of Sikhism, which is treated with great reverence.</li>
        <li><strong>The Amrit Sarovar:</strong> The holy pool surrounding the Golden Temple is considered sacred and is believed to have healing powers. Pilgrims come to bathe in its waters to purify their souls.</li>
