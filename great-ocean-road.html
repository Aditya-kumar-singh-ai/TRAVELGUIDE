    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>The Great Ocean Road was built between 1919 and 1932, primarily as a war memorial for soldiers who fought in World War I. It was constructed by returning soldiers using manual labor and hand tools. The road was originally designed to link isolated communities along the coast and provide better access to this remote region. Today, it stands as one of the most scenic drives in the world and is a symbol of Australian ingenuity and resilience.</p>

    <h2>Major Attractions</h2>
    <p>The Great Ocean Road is home to a variety of natural landmarks, historical sites, and stunning coastal views. Some of the top attractions include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>The Twelve Apostles</strong> – A series of limestone stacks that rise dramatically from the Southern Ocean, creating one of the most photographed landscapes in Australia.</li>
        <li><strong>Loch Ard Gorge</strong> – A beautiful cove with towering cliffs, named after the shipwreck of the Loch Ard, which occurred nearby in 1878.</li>
        <li><strong>London Arch</strong> – A natural rock arch that was once a bridge until part of it collapsed in 1990.</li>
        <li><strong>Great Otway National Park</strong> – A lush rainforest area perfect for hiking, camping, and enjoying wildlife, including koalas and kangaroos.</li>
        <li><strong>Apollo Bay</strong> – A charming coastal town offering sandy beaches, seafood, and a gateway to the Otway Ranges.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Wildlife and Nature</h2>
    <p>Along the Great Ocean Road, you'll find a wealth of diverse ecosystems and wildlife. The region is home to various species of birds, koalas, kangaroos, and even migrating whales. Popular wildlife watching spots include the Kennett River, where you can often spot koalas in the trees, and the marine parks near the Twelve Apostles, where dolphins and seals can be seen playing in the surf.</p>

    <h2>Best Time to Visit</h2>
    <p>The best time to visit the Great Ocean Road is during the Australian spring (September to November) and autumn (March to May), when the weather is mild, and the crowds are smaller. Summer (December to February) is also a popular time to visit, though it can get busy, especially around major attractions. Be sure to check the weather conditions before embarking on your journey, as coastal weather can change quickly.</p>

    <h2>How to Get There</h2>
    <p>The Great Ocean Road is easily accessible from Melbourne, which is about a 1.5-hour drive away. The road can be driven as a one-way route from Torquay to Warrnambool, or you can complete the full loop, returning to Melbourne via inland highways. There are also organized tours from Melbourne for those who prefer not to drive themselves.</p>
