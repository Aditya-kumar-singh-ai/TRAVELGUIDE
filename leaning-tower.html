        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>The Leaning Tower of Pisa (Torre Pendente di Pisa) is a freestanding bell tower of the cathedral in Pisa, Italy. It is renowned worldwide for its unintended tilt, which was caused by unstable foundation soil. Standing at approximately 57 meters (186 feet) tall, the tower is one of the most recognized and iconic landmarks in the world.</p>
        <p>Located in the Piazza dei Miracoli, the Leaning Tower of Pisa is part of the Cathedral of Pisa, the Baptistery, and the Camposanto Monumentale, all of which are UNESCO World Heritage Sites.</p>

    <section id="history">
        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>The construction of the Leaning Tower began in 1173 and took nearly 200 years to complete due to various interruptions, including wars and financial difficulties. The tilt started during construction when the foundation, built on soft, marshy ground, was unable to support the weight of the tower.</p>
        <p>Despite the tilt, work continued through various stages, with multiple attempts to correct the lean. The tower was completed in the 14th century, but its tilt remained a prominent feature. Over the centuries, engineers have worked to stabilize the tower, and in 2001, the tilt was reduced to a safe level through extensive restoration work.</p>

        <h2>Architecture</h2>
        <p>The Leaning Tower of Pisa is built in the Romanesque style, using white and grey marble. It has eight stories, including the chamber for the bells. The tower is composed of a circular stone structure, with a series of open arches on each floor that allow natural light to enter. The tower has a distinct architectural elegance, despite its infamous tilt.</p>
        <p>The bell tower is part of the cathedral complex and was designed to be a symbol of Pisaâ€™s wealth and religious significance. The tower was built to lean by accident, but it has since become one of the most photographed landmarks in the world, with visitors often posing with the tower as if they are "holding it up."</p>
