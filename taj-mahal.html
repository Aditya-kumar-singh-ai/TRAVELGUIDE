    <h2>History and Construction</h2>
    <p>Construction of the Taj Mahal began in 1632 and was largely completed in 1653, although some finishing touches continued into the 1660s.

It stands at a height of 73 meters (240 feet) and features a large central dome, surrounded by four minarets.</p>

    <h2>Architectural Significance</h2>

Its symmetrical gardens, reflecting pool, and the grand entrance gates all enhance its majestic beauty. The monument's design symbolizes paradise on earth, reflecting an idealized image of the Mughal empire.</p>

    <h2>Symbolism</h2>
    <p>Built as a tribute to the love between Shah Jahan and Mumtaz Mahal, the Taj Mahal has become a universal symbol of eternal love. It is often referred to as the "Crown of Palaces" and remains an architectural marvel admired by millions of visitors each year.</p>

    <h2>Preservation Efforts</h2>
