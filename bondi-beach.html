    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>Bondi Beach's name is derived from the Aboriginal word "Bondi," meaning "water breaking over rocks" or "noise of water." The beach became popular with European settlers in the late 19th century as a recreational area. In the 1920s, Bondi Beach gained fame as a surfing destination, and it remains one of Australia's top surfing spots to this day. Over time, the area surrounding the beach has developed into a bustling suburb filled with cafes, shops, and a vibrant cultural scene.</p>

    <h2>Attractions</h2>

The Bondi to Coogee walk also passes through lush parks, rock pools, and natural reserves, offering a variety of environments to explore.</p>
