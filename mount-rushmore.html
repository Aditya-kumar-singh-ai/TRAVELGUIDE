    <h1>Mount Rushmore National Memorial</h1>
    <p>America's Iconic Monument of Presidential History</p>
</header>

<section>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Mount Rushmore National Memorial is one of the most iconic landmarks in the United States, located in the Black Hills of South Dakota. The massive sculpture features the 60-foot-high faces of four U.S. Presidents: George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Theodore Roosevelt, and Abraham Lincoln. These figures were carved into the granite face of the mountain as a symbol of the nation's history and ideals. The monument attracts over 2 million visitors each year and stands as a testament to American history, art, and engineering.</p>

    <h2>History and Creation</h2>
    <p>The idea for Mount Rushmore was conceived by Doane Robinson, a South Dakota state historian, in the early 1920s. Robinson envisioned a grand monument to promote tourism in the state and showcase the American spirit. He initially proposed the project to feature western heroes like Lakota Chief Red Cloud, Buffalo Bill Cody, and the like, but the proposal was not accepted.</p>
    <p>In 1925, the sculptor Gutzon Borglum was commissioned to design the monument. Borglum, known for his work on the Stone Mountain Memorial in Georgia, selected the four U.S. Presidents for the project as a way to represent the nation's history, ideals, and democratic principles. Work began in 1927, and after Borglum’s death in 1941, his son Lincoln Borglum oversaw the completion of the project, which was finished in October 1941. The monument was created using dynamite and chisels, with thousands of tons of granite being removed to form the faces.</p>

    <h2>The Presidents on Mount Rushmore</h2>
    <p>The four faces carved into Mount Rushmore represent key moments in American history. Here's a closer look at each president featured:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>George Washington</strong> (1st President, 1789–1797) – Known as the "Father of the Nation," Washington was chosen to represent the birth of the United States and its foundational ideals of liberty and democracy.</li>
        <li><strong>Thomas Jefferson</strong> (3rd President, 1801–1809) – Jefferson, the principal author of the Declaration of Independence, symbolizes the growth of the nation and the expansion of its territory through the Louisiana Purchase and the Lewis and Clark Expedition.</li>
        <li><strong>Theodore Roosevelt</strong> (26th President, 1901–1909) – Roosevelt was selected for his role in expanding the nation’s influence globally, as well as his work on domestic reforms and the construction of the Panama Canal.</li>
        <li><strong>Abraham Lincoln</strong> (16th President, 1861–1865) – Lincoln, who led the country through the Civil War and abolished slavery, represents the preservation of the Union and the expansion of freedom in the United States.</li>
    </ul>

The summer months (June to August) see the highest number of visitors, so those looking for fewer crowds may prefer visiting in the spring or fall.</p>
    <p>Winter visits are possible but are less popular due to colder temperatures, snow, and some facilities being closed or operating with limited hours. However, Mount Rushmore can be particularly striking when covered with snow, offering a unique and peaceful experience.</p>
